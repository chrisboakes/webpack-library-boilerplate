# Simple Webpack Library Boilerplate
This is a starter boilerplate for writing javascript libraries. It uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) as a bundler and [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) as a testing tool.

## Structure
* `./src/js` - Javasscript source folder
* `./src/js/__test__` - Javasscript test folder
* `./src/scss` - CSS assosiated with the library (SCSS)
* `./example` - Example folder where you can test your library
* `./dist` - Compiled JS, CSS

### Note
Please make sure to change the project name in `package.json` file. This also changes the name of the compiled js and css file.
